# collab-dev-module
A uni project, a group project which turned into a solo effort (as they always do) , leaving it in my profile as it could be a fun one to have another go at in the future

I believe I got around a 65% just based on the fact I was the only one to work on the build ðŸ¤£

### The Brief
Your company has been approached by an online letting agency based in the North east of England to provide a secure network solution with an internal property management system.  Complete Property Solutions have their headquarters based in Gosforth.

### The following were the requirements of the project

- As an estate agent I need to be able to access the property management system while roaming.

- As a CTO (Chief Technology Officer) I would like Single Sign-On accounts to be available for all members of staff within the business (local and remote access to the network)

- As an estate agent I need the property management system to record all properties managed by the company

- As an estate agent I need the property management system to record all tenants that are resident in properties managed by the company

- As an estate agent I need the property management system to record which properties the landlords we provide a service to own.

- As an estate agent I need to be able to see any actions/inspections due on properties (gas inspection/property inspection) and update properties once actions/inspections have been carried out.
